## 📌  Key Findigs
🙎🏻‍♂️ **Customer Nodes Exploration:** There are 5 unique nodes on the Data Bank system. Each region has 5 nodes. Australia and Europe were allocated the highest and lowest number of customers respectively. Customers are reallocated every fortnight on average.

💵 **Customer Transactions:** Deposits were the most transactions made, and made the highest amount. Customers made 5 deposits on average, with $2718 as the average amount. January had the highest amount of returning customers.

📥 **Data Allocation Challenge:** Data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month using a running customer balance column that includes the impact of each transaction

## 💡 Recommendations
- To improve the security of the reallocations, the reallocation rate should reduce to an average of 7 days. If these reallocations can’t take place faster, they should be optimized to quicken during peak periods, such as around the end of year.
- Customers should be duly notified of their reallocations at most 2 days before they occur.
- Cloud Data storage spaces should be shared based on accrued interest for efficiency and equitability.
- Saving plans should be included into customers’ payments to increase their earned interest and storage allocations, and ultimately, to earn money for Data Bank.
